## External Dependencies

### CDN Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS**: `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` - Main styling framework
- **Font Awesome**: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css` - Icons

### No Backend Dependencies
- Pure client-side application
- No server-side processing required
- No database connections needed

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting
- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML/CSS/JS files
- **CDN Delivery**: External dependencies loaded from CDNs
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers with localStorage support

### Local Development
- **No Server Required**: Can run directly in browser
- **File Structure**: Single directory with HTML, CSS, and JS files
- **Testing**: Browser-based testing and debugging

### Production Considerations
- **Performance**: Minimal dependencies, fast loading
- **Security**: Client-side only, no server vulnerabilities
- **Scalability**: Limited to browser localStorage capacity
- **Backup**: No automatic backup (localStorage only)

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend-Only Architecture
- **Problem**: Need for simple, accessible financial tracking
- **Solution**: Client-side application with localStorage
- **Rationale**: Eliminates server costs and complexity while maintaining user privacy
- **Trade-offs**: Limited storage capacity, no cross-device sync

### Tailwind CSS Choice
- **Problem**: Need for responsive, professional styling
- **Solution**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Rationale**: Rapid development, consistent design, built-in responsiveness
- **Alternatives**: Bootstrap, custom CSS
- **Pros**: Fast development, small bundle size, highly customizable

### localStorage for Persistence
- **Problem**: Need to save user financial data
- **Solution**: Browser's localStorage API
- **Rationale**: No server required, immediate persistence, simple implementation
- **Trade-offs**: Data limited to single browser, no backup mechanism

### Vanilla JavaScript
- **Problem**: Need for dynamic financial calculations and DOM manipulation
- **Solution**: Pure JavaScript without frameworks
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, no learning curve, full control
- **Alternatives**: React, Vue, Angular
- **Pros**: Fast loading, no dependencies, simple debugging
